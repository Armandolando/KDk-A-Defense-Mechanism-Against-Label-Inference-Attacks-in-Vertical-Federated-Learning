# KDk: A Defense Mechanism Against Label Inference Attacks in Vertical Federated Learning

This repository provides the implementation of **KDk**, a novel defense mechanism designed to protect against label inference attacks in vertical federated learning (VFL). The approach employs soft labels to mitigate the risks associated with label inference, ensuring enhanced privacy and security for federated learning models.
